They have different pros and cons. Most people are familiar with the GUI as it is the default interface for most software, particularly on Windows and Mac OS. When using the GUI, you see and interact with visual representations of files, folders, applications, and most other functions of your computer. When using the CLI, you work largely with text representations of software, files, folders, input and output. The shell is a program that allows you to control your computer by typing instructions on the CLI with a keyboard.</p> <p>There are several reasons to learn how to use the CLI:</p> <ul> <li>For most bioinformatics tools, there are no graphical interfaces. If you want to work in metagenomics or genomics, you're going to need to use the CLI/ shell.</li> <li>The shell gives you power. The command line allows you to work more efficiently. Tasks that are repetitive (e.g. renaming hundreds of files) can be automated. Tasks that are tedious (e.g. testing a range of input parameters) can be simplified.</li> <li>To use remote computers or cloud computing, you often need to use the shell.</li> </ul> Lesson Overview Pre . Unix, Linux and UNIX Shell Quick overview on UNIX operating system and it's importance 1. Introducing the shell Introduce <code>cd</code> <code>ls</code> 2. Navigating files and directories moving around the filesystem. Introduce absolute vs relative path 3. Working with files and directories View, search within, copy, move, and rename files. Create new directories 4. Redirection Employ the grep command to search for information within files 5. Writing scripts and working with data How to use a terminal based text editor 6.

It was originally designed as a time-sharing system to serve several users simultaneously. Unix allows direct communication with the computer via a terminal, hence being very interactive and giving the user direct control over the computer resources. Unix also gives users the ability to share data and programs among one another.</p> <p>Unix is a generic operating system which takes full advantage of all available hardware such as 32-bit processor chips, expanded memory, and large, fast hard drives. Since Unix is written in a machine-independent language (C/C++) it is portable to many different types of machines including PC's. Therefore, Unix can be adapted to meet special requirements. The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell and the programs.</p> <p>On Unix philosophy</p> <p>\u201cAlthough that philosophy can\u2019t be written down in a single sentence, as its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.\u201d \u2013 Brian Kernighan &amp; Rob Pike</p> <p>The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell and the programs</p> <p>Kernel \u2212 The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management.</p> <p>Shell \u2212 The shell is the utility that processes your requests (acts as an interface between the user and the kernel). When you type in a command at your terminal, the shell interprets (operating as in interpreter) the command and calls the program that you want. The shell uses standard syntax for all commands. The shell recognises a limited set of commands, and you must give commands to the shell in a way that it understands: Each shell command consists of a command name, followed by command options (if any are desired) and command arguments (if any are desired). The command name, options, and arguments, are separated by blank space. </p> <ul> <li>An interpreter operates in a simple loop: It accepts a command, interprets the command, executes the command, and then waits for another command. The shell displays a \"prompt,\" to notify you that it is ready to accept your command.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"0-unixl-linux-overview/#unix-vs-linux","title":"UNIX vs. Linux","text":"<p>Linux is not Unix, but it is a \"Unix-like\" operating system.

It is denoted as sh. It gained popularity due to its compact nature and high speeds of operation.</p> <p>The C shell was created at the University of California by Bill Joy. It is denoted as csh. It was developed to include useful programming features like in-built support for arithmetic operations and a syntax similar to the C programming language.</p> <p>Further, it incorporated command history which was missing in different types of shells in Linux like the Bourne shell. Another prominent feature of a C shell is \u201caliases\u201d.</p> <p>The complete path-name for the C shell is <code>/bin/csh</code>. By default, it uses the prompt <code>hostname#</code> for the root user and <code>hostname%</code> for the non-root users.</p> <p>The Korn shell was developed at AT&amp;T Bell Labs by David Korn, to improve the Bourne shell. It is denoted as ksh. The Korn shell is essentially a superset of the Bourne shell.</p> <p>Besides supporting everything that would be supported by the Bourne shell, it provides users with new functionalities. It allows in-built support for arithmetic operations while offering interactive features which are similar to the C shell.</p> <p>The Korn shell runs scripts made for the Bourne shell, while offering string, array and function manipulation similar to the C programming language. It also supports scripts which were written for the C shell. Further, it is faster than most different types of shells. </p> <p>zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added.</p> <p>Fish is a fully-equipped command line shell (like bash or zsh) that is smart and user-friendly. Fish supports powerful features like syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and tab completions that just work, with nothing to learn or configure.</p> <p>If you want to make your command line more productive, more useful, and more fun, without learning a bunch of arcane syntax and configuration options, then fish might be just what you\u2019re looking for!</p>"},{"location":"0-unixl-linux-overview/#type-of-shell-for-this-workshop-gnu-bourne-again-shell-bash","title":"Type of Shell for this workshop: GNU Bourne-Again shell (bash)","text":"<p>The GNU Bourne-Again shell was designed to be compatible with the Bourne shell.

In the UK and US keyboard layouts, and several others, the <code>|</code> character can be found using the key combination Shift+\\.

This can be helpful for investigating your output if you are not sure you would like to save it to a file.</p> <p>Code</p> <pre><code>$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq | wc -l\n</code></pre> <p>Because we asked <code>grep</code> for all four lines of each FASTQ record, we need to divide the output by four to get the number of sequences that match our search pattern. Since 802 / 4 = 200.5 and we are expecting an integer number of records, there is something added or missing in <code>bad_reads.txt</code>. If we explore <code>bad_reads.txt</code> using <code>less</code>, we might be able to notice what is causing the uneven number of lines.

Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the amount of typing (and typing mistakes). Loops are helpful when performing operations on groups of sequencing files, such as unzipping or trimming multiple files. We will use loops for these purposes in subsequent analyses, but will cover the basics of them for now.</p> <p>When the shell sees the keyword <code>for</code>, it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list. Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the variable, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to the next item in the list. Inside the loop, we call for the variable's value by putting <code>$</code> in front of it. The <code>$</code> tells the shell interpreter to treat the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command. In shell programming, this is usually called \"expanding\" the variable.</p> <p>Basic Structure of a <code>for</code> loop</p> <p>The basic structure of a bash for loop looks like this: </p><pre><code>for variable in list\ndo\n    commands\ndone\n</code></pre><p></p> <p>Let's break down each part:</p> <ol> <li><code>for</code>: This keyword starts the loop.</li> <li><code>variable</code>: This is a temporary variable that takes on each value in the list, one at a time.</li> <li><code>in</code>: This keyword separates the variable from the list.</li> <li><code>list</code>: This is the set of items you want to loop through.</li> <li><code>do</code>: This keyword marks the beginning of the commands to be executed in each iteration.</li> <li><code>commands</code>: These are the actions you want to perform for each item in the list.</li> <li><code>done</code>: This keyword marks the end of the loop.</li> </ol> <p>Here's a simple example to help you understand: </p><pre><code>for fruit in apple banana orange\ndo\n    echo \"I like $fruit\"\ndone\n</code></pre> This loop will output: <pre><code>I like apple\nI like banana\nI like orange\n</code></pre><p></p> <p>How does it work: </p> <ol> <li>The loop starts with \"apple\" as the value of fruit.</li> <li>It executes the echo command with this value.</li> <li>Then it moves to the next item, \"banana\", and repeats.</li> <li>Finally, it does the same with \"orange\".</li> </ol> <p>After the last item, the loop ends.</p> <p>Remember, you can put any commands inside the loop, and they will be executed for each item in your list.

You will notice the shell prompt changes from <code>$</code> to <code>&gt;</code> and back again as we were typing in our loop.

The next line of the for loop is <code>do</code>. The next line is the code that we want to execute. We are telling the loop to print the first two lines of each variable we iterate over. Finally, the word <code>done</code> ends the loop.</p> <p>After executing the loop, you should see the first two lines of both fastq files printed to the terminal. Let's create a loop that will save this information to a file.</p> <pre><code>$ for filename in *.fastq\n&gt; do\n&gt; head -n 2 ${filename} &gt;&gt; seq_info.txt\n&gt; done\n</code></pre> <p>When writing a loop, you will not be able to return to previous lines once you have pressed Enter.

We're not going to type in a FASTA file, but we'll see as we go through other tutorials, there are a lot of reasons we'll want to write a file, or edit an existing file.</p> <p>To add text to files, we're going to use a text editor called Nano. We're going to create a file to take notes about what we've been doing with the data files in <code>~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq</code>.</p> <p>This is good practice when working in bioinformatics. We can create a file called <code>README.txt</code> that describes the data files in the directory or documents how the files in that directory were generated. As the name suggests, it's a file that we or others should read to understand the information in that directory.</p> <p>Let's change our working directory to <code>~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq</code> using <code>cd</code>, then run <code>nano</code> to create a file called <code>README.txt</code>:</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ cd ~/shell_data/untrimmed_fastq\n$ nano README.txt\n</code></pre> <p>You should see something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>The text at the bottom of the screen shows the keyboard shortcuts for performing various tasks in <code>nano</code>. We will talk more about how to interpret this information soon.</p> <p>Which Editor?</p> <p>When we say, \"<code>nano</code> is a text editor,\" we really do mean \"text\": <code>nano</code> can only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other human-friendly media. We use <code>nano</code> in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, <code>nano</code> may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X), many programmers use Emacs or Vim (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as Gedit. On Windows, you may wish to use Notepad++. Windows also has a built-in editor called <code>notepad</code> that can be run from the command line in the same way as <code>nano</code> for the purposes of this lesson.</p> <p>No matter what editor you use, you will need to know the default location where it searches for files and where files are saved. If you start an editor from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer's start menu, the editor may want to save files in your desktop or documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you \"Save As...\"</p> <p>Let's type in a few lines of text. Describe what the files in this directory are or what you've been doing with them. Once we're happy with our text, we can press Ctrl-O (press the Ctrl or Control key and, while holding it down, press the O key) to write our data to disk. You'll be asked what file we want to save this to: press Return to accept the suggested default of <code>README.txt</code>.</p> <p>Once our file is saved, we can use Ctrl-X to quit the <code>nano</code> editor and return to the shell.</p> <p>Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key</p> <p>The Control key is also called the \"Ctrl\" key. There are various ways in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may see an instruction to press the Ctrl key and, while holding it down, press the X key, described as any of:</p> <ul> <li><code>Control-X</code></li> <li><code>Control+X</code></li> <li><code>Ctrl-X</code></li> <li><code>Ctrl+X</code></li> <li><code>^X</code></li> <li><code>C-x</code></li> </ul> <p>In <code>nano</code>, along the bottom of the screen you'll see <code>^G Get Help ^O WriteOut</code>. This means that you can use Ctrl-G to get help and Ctrl-O to save your file.</p> <p>Now you've written a file. You can take a look at it with <code>less</code> or <code>cat</code>, or open it up again and edit it with <code>nano</code>.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Open <code>README.txt</code> and add the date to the top of the file and save the file.</p> Solution <p>Use <code>nano README.txt</code> to open the file. Add today's date and then use Ctrl-X followed by <code>y</code> and Enter to save.</p>"},{"location":"05-writing-scripts/#writing-scripts","title":"Writing scripts","text":"<p>A really powerful thing about the command line is that you can write scripts. Scripts let you save commands to run them and also lets you put multiple commands together. Though writing scripts may require an additional time investment initially, this can save you time as you run them repeatedly. Scripts can also address the challenge of reproducibility: if you need to repeat an analysis, you retain a record of your command history within the script.</p> <p>One thing we will commonly want to do with sequencing results is pull out bad reads and write them to a file to see if we can figure out what's going on with them. We're going to look for reads with long sequences of N's like we did before, but now we're going to write a script, so we can run it each time we get new sequences, rather than type the code in by hand each time.</p> <p>We're going to create a new file to put this command in.

Usually, however, most analyses begin with moving data onto the instance. Below we'll show you some commands to download data onto your instance, or to move data between your computer and the cloud.</p> <p>Getting data from the cloud</p> <p>There are two programs that will download data from a remote server to your local (or remote) machine: <code>wget</code> and <code>curl</code>.

Of course, while it's best to get yourself organised before you even begin your analyses, it's never too late to start, either.</p> <p>You should approach your sequencing project similarly to how you do a biological experiment and this ideally begins with experimental design. We're going to assume that you've already designed a beautiful sequencing experiment to address your biological question, collected appropriate samples, and that you have enough statistical power to answer the questions you're interested in asking. These steps are all incredibly important, but beyond the scope of our course. For all of those steps (collecting specimens, extracting DNA, prepping your samples) you've likely kept a lab notebook that details how and why you did each step. However, the process of documentation doesn't stop at the sequencer!</p> <p>Genomics projects can quickly accumulate hundreds of files across tens of folders. Every computational analysis you perform over the course of your project is going to create many files, which can especially become a problem when you'll inevitably want to run some of those analyses again. For instance, you might have made significant headway into your project, but then have to remember the PCR conditions you used to create your sequencing library months prior.</p> <p>Other questions might arise along the way:</p> <ul> <li>What were your best alignment results?</li> <li>Which folder were they in: Analysis1, AnalysisRedone, or AnalysisRedone2?</li> <li>Which quality cutoff did you use?</li> <li>What version of a given program did you implement your analysis in?</li> </ul> <p>Good documentation is key to avoiding this issue, and luckily enough, recording your computational experiments is even easier than recording lab data. Copy/Paste will become your best friend, sensible file names will make your analysis understandable by you and your collaborators, and writing the methods section for your next paper will be easy! Remember that in any given project of yours, it's worthwhile to consider a future version of yourself as an entirely separate collaborator.

Our column headers are in the first row of our data table, so we can use <code>head</code> with a <code>-n</code> flag to look at just the first row of the file.</p> <pre><code>$ head -n 1 SraRunTable.txt\n</code></pre> <pre><code>BioSample_s InsertSize_l    LibraryLayout_s Library_Name_s  LoadDate_s  MBases_l    MBytes_l    ReleaseDate_s Run_s SRA_Sample_s Sample_Name_s Assay_Type_s AssemblyName_s BioProject_s Center_Name_s Consent_s Organism_Platform_s SRA_Study_s g1k_analysis_group_s g1k_pop_code_s source_s strain_s\n</code></pre> <p>That is only the first line of our file, but because there are a lot of columns, the output likely wraps around your terminal window and appears as multiple lines. Once we figure out which column our data is in, we can use a command called <code>cut</code> to extract the column of interest.</p> <p>Because this is pretty hard to read, we can look at just a few column header names at a time by combining the <code>|</code> redirect and <code>cut</code>.</p> <pre><code>$ head -n 1 SraRunTable.txt | cut -f1-4\n</code></pre> <p><code>cut</code> takes a <code>-f</code> flag, which stands for \"field\". This flag accepts a list of field numbers, in our case, column numbers. Here we are extracting the first four column names.</p> <pre><code>BioSample_s InsertSize_l      LibraryLayout_s   Library_Name_s    \n</code></pre> <p>The LibraryLayout_s column looks like it should have the information we want.  Let's look at some of the data from that column. We can use <code>cut</code> to extract only the 3<sup>rd</sup> column from the file and then use the <code>|</code> operator with <code>head</code> to look at just the first few lines of data in that column.</p> <pre><code>$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | head -n 10\n</code></pre> <pre><code>LibraryLayout_s\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nSINGLE\nPAIRED\n</code></pre> <p>We can see that there are (at least) two categories, SINGLE and PAIRED.  We want to search all entries in this column for just PAIRED and count the number of matches. For this, we will use the <code>|</code> operator twice to combine <code>cut</code> (to extract the column we want), <code>grep</code> (to find matches) and <code>wc</code> (to count matches).</p> <pre><code>$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | grep PAIRED | wc -l\n</code></pre> <pre><code>2\n</code></pre> <p>We can see from this that we have only two paired-end libraries in the samples we submitted for sequencing.</p> <p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge</p>"},{"location":"Supplementary/1-supplementary/#exercise","title":"Exercise","text":"<p>How many single-end libraries are in our samples?</p> <p>:::::::::::::::  solution</p>"},{"location":"Supplementary/1-supplementary/#solution","title":"Solution","text":"<pre><code>$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | grep SINGLE | wc -l\n</code></pre> <pre><code>35\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Supplementary/1-supplementary/#how-many-of-each-class-of-library-layout-are-there","title":"How many of each class of library layout are there?","text":"<p>We can extract even more information from our metadata table if we add in some new tools: <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code>. The <code>sort</code> command will sort the lines of a text file and the <code>uniq</code> command will filter out repeated neighboring lines in a file. You might expect <code>uniq</code> to extract all of the unique lines in a file. This isn't what it does, however, for reasons involving computer memory and speed. If we want to extract all unique lines, we can do so by combining <code>uniq</code> with <code>sort</code>. We'll see how to do this soon.</p> <p>For example, if we want to know how many samples of each library type are recorded in our table, we can extract the third column (with <code>cut</code>), and pipe that output into <code>sort</code>.</p> <pre><code>$ cut -f3 SraRunTable.txt | sort\n</code></pre> <p>If you look closely, you might see that we have one line that reads \"LibraryLayout_s\". This is the header of our column.

We can use the <code>uniq</code> command to see a list of all the different categories that are present.

We may want to be able to run this command over and over again without needing to copy and paste it and allow the user to specify exactly which file they want to examine for bad reads.</p> <p>We can accomplish these goals by including the above command in a script that takes in user input via a command line argument. We can slightly modify our <code>bad-reads-script.sh</code> file to do so. Use <code>c</code> to copy your <code>bad-reads-script.sh</code> into a new script called <code>custom-bad-reads-script.sh</code>.
